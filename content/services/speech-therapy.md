## What is Speech Therapy?

Our speech therapy sessions are designed to help children communicate effectively and confidently. We focus on:

* **Articulation:** Producing sounds correctly.
* **Fluency:** Improving the flow of speech.
* **Expressive Language:** Using words to convey meaning.

We use play-based techniques to make learning fun!
